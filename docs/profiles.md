# Profiles

This document defines built-in profiles for npkill. A profile is a named preset of "safe-to-delete" directories for a given ecosystem.

While these directories are **generally safe to delete**, it all depends on their context. Therefore, it is important to verify the result shown before deleting it. However, we have tried to maintain a conservative list.

- Profiles are opt-in via `--profiles` (comma-separated). Example: `--profiles node,python`.
- Only directory base names are matched (the last path segment) (more advanced heuristics will be implemented in the future).
- All targets below are rebuildable caches, dependencies, or compiled outputs. So doesnt should have any problem deleting it. But before delete, peek if is secure to remove for your case.

Default behavior

- By default (no `--profiles`), npkill use the `node` profile.

Special profile: all

- `all` includes every target listed in all profiles below. Use with care if you want a full clean sweep.
